I have a lot of history with Python, and Im' interested in using it as a web/API/RSS server. I'm working through Miguel Grinberg's Flask Mega-Tutorial to get a feel for it.

You can do this too. Start with [Chapter 1](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

This tutorial, beginning with chapter 4, makes heavy use of [SqlAlchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/).
